# Diffusion_models_app


Showcase of diffusion models. Goes along with the [notebook](https://github.com/farmaker47/Diffusion_models_app/blob/colab_with_ngrok_api/GPU_Ngrok_Diffusion_deployment.ipynb). Run the notebook from top to bottom with a free session of Colab and get use of the GPU. In the end ngrok will give you an address which you can place it at [this](https://github.com/farmaker47/Diffusion_models_app/blob/colab_with_ngrok_api/app/src/main/python/run_diffusion_model.py#L17) line of code.

Tokenizer with python implementation is used.

You can download the encoder.tflite [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qE_3_m8cTPpgbCzek9St5ZJGWzLZ68ic/view?usp=share_link) and place it inside the assets folder or the internal storage of the mobile phone.

Diffusion and Decoder model are running online due to map errors.
